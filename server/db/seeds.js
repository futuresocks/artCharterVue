    artistWebsite: "https://www.facebook.com/R0GUE0NER/",
    about: "Working with Art Pistol, Rogue-One has added to his existing portfolio of murals with another quirky installation here on John Street. Rogue described his inspiration: We thought that an interesting concept would be to have body-poppers or break-dancers in puppet form. I took my influence from a Beastie Boys cover and a Run DMC picture.",
    nearby: "This mural is in the heart of the city centre, adjacent to George Square – the principal civic square in Glasgow – and numerous transport links. Close by is Glasgow City Chambers. Completed in 1888, the City Chambers has for over a hundred years been the headquarters of successive councils serving the City of Glasgow. Free tours of the Chambers are conducted twice per day at 10.30am and 2.30pm and will accommodate anyone walking in from the street to join the tour.",

Like a giant crocodile hunting the concrete jungle, the full scale of this animal is only realised from a certain angle, and this wrap around corner effect was the main reason for choosing the cunning beast.",
